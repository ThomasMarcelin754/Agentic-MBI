Build a 5-year DCF model:

**Step 1: Revenue Projections**
- Apply growth rates: Years 1-5 as specified
- Sanity check vs sector trends (e.g., CVC mature = 3-5%, IRVE growth = 10-15%)

**Step 2: EBITDA Projections**
- Target margin: {ebitda_margin}%
- Account for: Synergies (if platform), scaling efficiencies

**Step 3: Free Cash Flow**
- FCF = EBITDA × (1 - Tax Rate) - Capex - Δ NWC
- Capex = {capex_percent}% of revenue
- NWC = {nwc_percent}% of revenue

**Step 4: Terminal Value**
- Gordon Growth: TV = FCF_Year5 × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
- g = {terminal_growth_rate}%

**Step 5: NPV**
- Discount at WACC = {wacc}%
- EV = PV(FCF 1-5) + PV(TV)

**Step 6: Sensitivity Analysis**
- WACC: ±2pp (e.g., if 10%, test 8%, 10%, 12%)
- Terminal growth: ±1pp

   - 30-40% earn-out over 2-3 years (EBITDA-based)
   - Option: 10-20% equity rollover in newco

3. **Growth Capital (scale business)**
   - 40-50% cash (seller keeps majority initially)
   - Vendor loan possible
   - Significant equity rollover
   - Management retention package

**Financing Constraints:**
- Available cash: {available_cash}€
- Can use debt: up to 3x EBITDA (senior) + 1x mezzanine
- Vendor loan: typically 10-20% of EV, 5-7 years, 3-5% interest
